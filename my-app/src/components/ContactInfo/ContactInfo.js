            What is contact information?
            Your contact information, also called a resume header, 
            is the section of your resume that features details that describe 
            who you are and how a hiring manager can reach you. It can include 
            information such as your name, phone number and email. 
            It may also include your professional portfolio, website or links 
            to professional social media platforms if relevant to the role you're applying for. 
            Since the header is the first thing hiring managers see on your resume, 
            it's best to introduce yourself.
            During the hiring process, employers use the contact information 
            listed on your resume to provide updates about your job application, 
            including contacting you to schedule initial interviews and filling out 
            paperwork regarding your pending employment. Since it aids in the application process, 
            it's essential to feature this information at the top of the page so 
            it's easy to find and read, especially if a hiring manager reviews several 
            candidates' resumes for the role.
